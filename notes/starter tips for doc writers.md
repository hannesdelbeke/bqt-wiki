### starter tips for doc writers
These docs are edited with [Obsidian](http://www.obsidian.md):
- use `[[title of note]]` to link to a page (this is called [wikilink](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:Link))
- select text, and paste a URL on it to link to other sites.
- use `# `, `## `or `### ` in front of a sentence to create a header.
- GitHub wiki is less advanced than Obsidian, avoid fancy features that only work in Obsidian. 
- A new line in GitHub requires the previous line to end in 2 spaces. This wont show in Obsidian.
