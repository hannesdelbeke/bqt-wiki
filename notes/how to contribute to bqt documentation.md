First, read the [[README]]

## First time contributor, help?
This will sound complex, and like a lot, but if you try step by step and google when you get stuck, or ask questions [here](https://github.com/techartorg/bqt/issues/92), you'll get there. 
(Don't be afraid of making a mistake, you can't break the project if you're not admin.)
Here we goÂ ðŸš¶:  
- you will need to fork the repo with all branches
- then clone the forked repo (big green button at the top on the front page)
- swap branch to the wiki branch
- open the folder in obsidian, and edit the text files (make a test change to anything)
- make a single edit, push it to your fork
- create a PR, and an admin should be able to review it. Once you successfully created a PR, feel free to close it. You are now ready to make real PRs.

For your next steps, make actual changes to the docs.
Then repeat the above steps to push the changes, and create a PR.
Review it with a maintainer, maybe implement their feedback, and iterate on it until it get's merged in.

## What should I work on
Check out the [issues](https://github.com/techartorg/bqt/issues) with the  `documentation` tag.
