It's recommended to install bqt as an addon, so it can be disabled, and bqt's startup code is automatically run on Blender startup.
Install as addon requires you to pip install the dependencies.

- [[install as addon]]
- [[install as module]]

bqt contributors might want to install with [[setup bqt develop environment]].
