Hello fellow doc writer.

- The [[Home]] page is [the front page](https://github.com/techartorg/bqt/wiki) on GitHub wiki, aimed at devs or users who want to find out more about bqt.

### goal of the docs 
- anyone can read how bqt works, and why
- anyone can follow instructions on how to use it
- the docs should never assume anyone knows anything, and explain things from scratch.
- docs should be as short as possible, look up "tight writing". 
- docs are mostly aimed at devs who want to start using bqt for their tools.
