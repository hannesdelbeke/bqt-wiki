Hello fellow doc writer.

- The current page you're on, is [the front page](https://github.com/techartorg/bqt/tree/wiki) on GitHub repo, and is aimed at people who want to contribute to the documentation. Private notes for documentation contributors go here.
- The [[Home]] page is [the front page](https://github.com/techartorg/bqt/wiki) on GitHub wiki, aimed at devs or users who want to find out more about bqt.

## doc write notes

These docs are edited with [Obsidian](http://www.obsidian.md), some tips for starters:
- use `[[title of note]]` to link to a page (this is called [wikilink](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:Link))
- select text, and paste a URL on it to link to other sites.
- use `# `, `## `or `### ` in front of a sentence to create a header.

The goal of the docs, should be that 
- anyone can read how bqt works, and why
- anyone can follow instructions on how to use it
- the docs should never assume anyone knows anything, and explain things from scratch.
- docs should be as short as possible, look up "tight writing".
