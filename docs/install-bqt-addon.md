Installing bqt as an addon means less coding for you.
- The bqt startup code automatically runs on Blender startup.  
- You can disable bqt by disabling the addon.

You can either install through plugget or manually install the addon and its dependencies.

## Plugget  (recommended)

1. Download the [plugget blender addon](https://github.com/hannesdelbeke/plugget-blender-addon/raw/main/installer/install_plugget_addon.blend) by clicking on the link.
2. Find the install file in your downloads folder.

4. Run the scripts inside to install the addon.
5. Find the Plugget addon by going to `Edit > Preferences > Add-ons`.
6. Type bqt into the search box and click search.
7. Click install. This installs the bqt addon and all its dependencies.

1. Download the latest release. You can download the zip from the repo.
2. Extract the zip and copy the `bqt` folder to your blender addons folder.
3. (ADVANCED) Ensure the dependencies are installed from `requirements.txt`  
   
   Use the [[Blender python interpreter]] instead of `python`
```bash
cd "your/bqt/folder/path"
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```
4. Enable the addon by going to `Edit > Preferences > Add-ons` and search for `qt`
